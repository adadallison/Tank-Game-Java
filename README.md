# Tank-Game-Java


## Project Overview:
My project is a typical Tank Wars game where two players exist that, each with the objec+ve to win the game by firing bullets at the other player until 
the other player has no more lives. The game is Super Mario Bros. themed, and uses power ups to replenish players’ health, lives, and give them bulletproof 
abili+es. To realize this game Java Swing and other libraries to develop GUIs. The game allows two players, and the objec+ve is to basically not die. The tanks 
are able to shoot one another and reduce the health count and life count of the other tank, and if they life count of one tank reaches zero, then that player 
loses. They play the game within the game panel, and also shoot breakable walls to create navigate more easily. Throughout the game a player can replenish itself 
with two kinds of power ups; one power up gives the player an extra life, another replenishes its health, and the other allows the player to be bullet proof for
a certain amount of +me. Each player starts out with 3 lives and is able to obtain a maximum of 5 lives; 1 life = 100 health counts, and each bullet fired at a 
tank reduces its health count by 10. Once the game is over, we are told which player won, and the player can exit.

## How to Build/Import Project:
Once you copy the HTTP link from GitHub, from my repository, you can use your terminal to perform git clone and it will clone a local repository,
typically on ones desktop, where the folder will then be . An easier way might be to go to GitHub and search for the GitHub repository link 
(https://github.com/adadallison/Tank-Game-Java). If you press code, now you can see ‘Download ZIP files,’ which will allow the folder to directly
download to your computer. To import the project correctly onto an IDE, open your IDE and selected “import project,” select the folder and then press Open. 
Once the file is open, the Launcher class can run the project, or running the jar file in the jar folder can also do that.
